		<h1>Problem Statement</h1>
			<p> Our team wants to introduce a new way of operating an individual’s device. Whether it be a laptop, desktop computer, tablet, 
			or mobile phone, our software should work on any device that can allow access to a camera. 
			At the base level, our software will be able to be used for e-reading, or reading on a device as opposed to a physical book. 
			Instead of the user having to use their hands or fingers to choose a book, flip a page, zoom in, etc., they will be able to 
			solely use eye movement and head gestures. For example, a head swing from the RIGHT to the LEFT could indicate flipping 
			forward a page. A double blink might be to select or “click” something. There are two main motivations for this project, 
			with the first being those who a physical handicap like dexterity issues or amputations making it difficult to navigate 
			point and click devices. The other motivation was for those people who just want an easy and comfortable way to read an 
			e-book on a device without using their hands every couple of seconds. We believe our software will be able to increase 
			productivity and personal happiness of the individuals who are struggling. Currently, we do not believe there to be 
			anything like this available to people. The only thing that is similar would be Tobii eyeX, which is an eye control software
			 for computers. However, Tobii uses their own camera which needs to be permanently mounted onto a computer, so this would 
			 not be ideal for tablets or smaller devices.

		<h1>Methodology</h1>
			<h2>Data Collection</h2>
				<p> This project uses three need-finding techniques to address the questions of the problem statements:</p>
				
				<ul> 
					<li> Survey: An online survey that questions which way the user would like to be able to turn the page using motions from 
					their head and/or eyes. This can be expanded to ask successive questions about other features within the program.
					</li>
					
					<li> Interview: Speaking with people who may have a need for the program could be very insightful for our design.
					</li>
					
					<li> Observation: Observing individuals using our product could better help us understand what changes could be made to increase 
					user easy and efficiency.
					</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p> A survey is used to quickly receive feedback from potential users on ideas or design techniques within the program itself. 
				An interview will help by providing us with in-depth reasonings for why certain people believe certain features would be beneficial, 
				and how it would help them. Observation will be used more for testing the design of our program and ensuring it is easy to navigate 
				and set up as well as easy to understand and use without much external instructions.
				</p>
				
		<h1>Participant Category</h1>
			<p> Two types of participants are involved in the analysis: Primary User and Secondary User. The characteristics of these participants, and the 
			reason behind selecting them go as follows:
